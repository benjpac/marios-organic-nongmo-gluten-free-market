# README

You've in the running for a freelance development job, as the developer for Mario's Speciality Food Products (or another fictional company of your choosing, if you'd prefer). This is your chance to take on your first long-term contract, but first Mario wants to make sure you're the right person for the job. He's asked you for an MVP and wants it by 5:00 tonight. The stakes are higher than usual, since Mario's old site had thousands of unique visitors each day. If you can get the job, this is a great way to increase your profile as a developer.
